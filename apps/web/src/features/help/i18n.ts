An arc groups several related objectives (e.g. \"improve accuracy over 30 days\" followed by \"sustain KDA ≥ 3 the following week\").\n\nTwo evaluation modes:\n• Threshold — reach the target in a single match (e.g. \"20 kills in one match\").\n• Cumulative — accumulate across the full window (e.g. \"500 kills in a month\").\n\nTwo creation modes:\n• Free — the metric, target, and window are chosen freely.\n• Guided — LevelUp suggests an objective calibrated to the player's history.\n\nObjectives can be individual (stored in the player profile) or squad-level (shared across squad members). Squad challenges offer two dynamics:\n• Collective — every member contributes toward a shared target (e.g. \"1 000 kills combined this week\").\n• Competitive — members race on the same metric and rank against each other.\n\nEach completed objective awards Prestige Points (PP) based on its tier (Normal, Heroic, Legendary, Mythic).",
